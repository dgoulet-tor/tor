  o Minor bugfixes (onion service v3, client authorization):
    - When removing client authorization credentials using the control port,
      also remove the associated descriptor so they don't linger and are still
      usable hence making the onion service behind client authorization
      reachable. Fixes bug 33148; bugfix on 0.4.3.1-alpha.
