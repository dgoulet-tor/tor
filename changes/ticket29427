  o Major bugfixes (cell scheduler, KIST):
    - Only for clients (which includes onion services), set the KIST cell
      scheduler interval to 2msec instead of 10msece which is the default
      value for relays. Client are often single socket so this change will
      make them not sleep even though data could be sent on the wire. This is
      a partial fix to a bigger architectural problem. Fixes bug 29427; bugfix
      on 0.3.2.2-alpha.
